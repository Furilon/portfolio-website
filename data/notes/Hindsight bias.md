> Hindsight bias. If you see one-sided evidence for some ambiguous (moral, say) question and you change your mind, it's really hard to reestablish your prior beliefs - you will take your current ones instead. This will inevitably make you underestimate the degree to which you were surprised by certain things.
Hindsight bias has pernicious effects of the evaluations of decision makers. It leads observers to assess the quality of a decision not by whether the process was sound but by whether its outcome was good or bad.
We are prone to blame for decisions that worked out badly and to give too little credit for successful moves that appear obvious only after the fact. There is a clear outcome bias.
