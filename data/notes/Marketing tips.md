> [!NOTE]
> The general principle is that anything you can do to reduce the cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize ligibility.
> 1. If your message is to be printed, use high-quality paper to maximize the contrast between characters and their background.
> 2. If you use color, you are more likely to be believed if your text is printed in bright blue or red than in middling shades of green, yellow, or pale blue.
> 3. If you care about being thought creduble and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do: couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sight of poor intelligence and low credibility.
> 4. Try to make it memorable; put your ideas in verse if you can.
> 5. If you quote a source, choose one with a name that is easy to pronounce. If possible, the recipients of your message want to stay away from anythong that reminds them of effort, including a source with a complicated name.
