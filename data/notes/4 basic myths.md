# 4 basic myths

> [!NOTE]
> Good myths provide answers to these three questions:
> 1. What is the nature (meaning, the significance) of current state?
> 2. To what (desirable) end should it be moving?
> 3. What are the processes by which the current state might be transformed into the desired state?
> 
> There are 4 basic myths:
> 1. That describe a current or pre-existent stable state (paradise, tyranny);
> 2. That describe appearance of something anomalous, threatening and promising into this initial state;
> 3. That describe the dissolution of the pre-existent stable state into chaos, as a consequence of the anomalous or unexpected occurence;
> 4. That describe the regeneration of stability (paradise regained or tyranny regenerated), from the chaotic mixture of dissolute previous experience and anomalous information.
