> Putting participants in a good mood before the test by having them think happy thought more than doubled accuracy. An even more striking result is that unhappy subjects were completely incapable of performing the intuitive task accurately; their guesses were no better than random.

When in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.
