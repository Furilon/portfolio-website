> The idea that effort is tiring. The more you force yourself to do something, the less willing you are to do the next task. Ego depleted people quit problems faster. This is related to glucose consumption: the nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose. When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive reasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood glucose level drops. The effect is undone by ingesting glucose.
