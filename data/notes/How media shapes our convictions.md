> [!NOTE]
> "the lesson is clear: estimates of death are wrapped by media coverage. The coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy. The media do not just shape what the public interested in, but also are shaped by it. Editors cannot ignore the public's demands that certain topics and viewpoints receive extensive coverage. Unusual events (such as botulism) attract disproportionate attention and are consequently perceived as less unusual than they are. The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed"
