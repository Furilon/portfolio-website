> [!NOTE]
> Always stay on the side of the weak. If they will win, you will get benefits; if they will lose, then you will form an ally and win in the future.
Picking the side of the strong won't bring you anything because you will be inferior to the great one, so to speak, and dependent of that one not turning against you.
