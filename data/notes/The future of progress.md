> Peter Thiel's answer to the question, what is the truth that nobody agrees with you on, is this: globalization is not the future - technology is. Globalization is a horizontal progress, a way of copying worked technologies, while technology is a way of doing more with less - journey from 0 to 1. 
If China doubles its energy production, it will double air pollution as well. If everyone in India's hundreds of millions of households will live the way Americans do today - with today's tools only - the result would be environmentally catastrophic. Spreading old ways of acquiring wealth will lead to devastation, not riches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization is unsustainable without technology
