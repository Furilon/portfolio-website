> Anchoring as insufficient adjustment neatly explains why drivers tend to drive on higher speeds in cities after highways, and why teenagers who love loud music quarrel with their parents (because in both cases their perception of low/quite is anchored by their previous experience of high/loud). People adjust less if their cognitive resources are depleted: their memory is loaded or they are slightly drunk.
