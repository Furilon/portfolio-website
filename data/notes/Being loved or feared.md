> [!NOTE]
> Essentially, the question is whether it is better to be loved or to be feared. Macciavelli's answer is the latter
"...but since love and fear can hardly coexist together, if we must choose between then, is is far safer to be feared than loved. For of men it may generally be affirmed that they are thankless, fickle, false, studious to avoing danger, greedy of gain, devoted to you while you are able to confer bemefits upon them..." p. 43
"Moreover, men are less careful how they offend him who makes himself loved than him who makes himself feared. For love is held by the tie of obligation, which, because men are a sorry breed, is broken on every whisper of private interest, but fear is bound by the apprehension of punishment which never relaxss its grasp." p. 44 
"Being loved depends on his subjects, being feared depends on himself."
