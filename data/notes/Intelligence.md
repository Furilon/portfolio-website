> [!NOTE]
> Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it's also an ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed. Everyone has the option of slowing down to conduct an active search of memory for all possibly relevant facts. The extent of deliberate checking and search is a characteristic of System 2, which varies among individuals.
