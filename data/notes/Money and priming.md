> [!NOTE]
> Money-primed people become more independent than they would be without the associative trigger. They are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time helping another student who pretended to be confused about an experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on their mind picked up fewer pencils. They chose to stay much farther apart than their nonprimed peers when asked to move a chair for another participant. They also showed a greater preference for being alone. The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accpet demands from others. Kathlees Voh's findings suggests that living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and out attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.
