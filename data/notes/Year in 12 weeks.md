> [!NOTE]
> 12-week yearly plan should be planned on the basis of weeks.
There also should be an weekly accountability program in front of a mentor/peers.
There are lead and lag indicators. Lag indicator is an end result. Lead indicator is what causes the lag indicator. 
Three types of time:
Strategic block - 3h - when you work uninterruptedly, no exceptions;
Buffer block - 1h - once/twice a day to deal with all the interruptions in 1 go;
Breakout blocks - 3h - once/twice a week to keep yourself sane;
